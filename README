projectoxford
=============

Python client library for `Project Oxford <https://projectoxford.ai/>`__ APIs.

Microsoft Project Oxford is a collection of artificial intelligence tools made available as online services. This library provides easy use of the Project Oxford APIs from Python.

Currently only the speech recognition, synthesis and `LUIS <https://luis.ai/>`__ APIs are implemented.

Installation
------------

To install, use pip:

.. code:: shell

    pip install projectoxford

This library is in an early stage of development. We strongly recommend pinning all references to the specific version you are using.

Getting Started
---------------

To use text to speech or speech recognition, you'll need to `obtain a subscription key <https://projectoxford.ai/speech>`__. 

.. code:: python

    from projectoxford.speech import SpeechClient
    sc = SpeechClient("YOUR-KEY-GOES-HERE", gender='Male', locale='en-US')

You can use ``sc.say_to_wav`` to create a wave file containing synthesized speech, or ``sc.say`` to immediately play the speech.

.. code:: python

    data = sc.say_to_wav("Hello. I have been written to a file.", filename="test.wav")
    sc.say("I am being read out loud, right now.")

You can use ``sc.recognize`` to convert speech in a wave file into text, or without providing a file to record up to 30 seconds from the user's default microphone.

If the response indicates that it does not have high confidence in the result, a ``LowConfidenceError`` is raised. ``args[0]`` on the error contains the best guess at the text. If no result can be determined at all, ``ValueError`` is raised.

The ``recognize_raw`` method returns the JSON response from the service, which contains more information than is available from ``recognize``.

.. code:: python

    from projectoxford.speech import LowConfidenceError
    text = sc.recognize('some_speech.wav')
    
    try:
        text = sc.recognize()
    except LowConfidenceError as err:
        text = err.args[0]
    
    json_data = sc.recognize_raw()

Functions ``sc.print`` and ``sc.input`` can be used to override the builtin ``print`` and ``input`` functions to easily convert existing code.

.. code:: python

    print = sc.print
    input = sc.input
    
    print("Welcome to my application.")
    name = input("What is your name?")

Audio playback and recording is performed by the ``projectoxford.audio`` module. Currently, only Windows is supported, and the user's default device is always used.

By default, ``record`` waits for some sound to be heard, then records until one second of silence. Use the `quiet_threshold` argument to adjust sensitivity, and the `get_quiet_threshold` function can to obtain this value by recording a short period of silence.

The ``play`` function takes a filename or the raw contents of a wave file and plays the entire sound before returning.

.. code:: python

    from projectoxford.audio import play, record
    wave_file_contents = record()
    play(wave_file_contents)
    
    # Record for 5 seconds
    data = record(seconds=5, quiet_seconds=0, wait_for_sound=False)

Use ``help(record)`` to review other arguments.

Contributing
------------

Over time we hope to add the full range of Project Oxford APIs to this library. Contributions are welcome.
